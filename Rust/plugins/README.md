Rubenrua Rust GStreamer plugin set
====================================

A personal set of GStreamer plugins was implemented in Rust. Plugins
are for experimenting with ideas, debugging, or maybe good ideas that
will be tried upstream.

Another objective of the repository is to maintain the history of
creating the plugin, which may not be interesting for the community
but for me.
